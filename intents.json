Most fundamental is Moore's Law which has driven an exponential growth in computing, storage, and communications per rupee over the past 50 years. This rate of growth shows no signs of abating. Consequently, today we have the Internet of Things: a plethora of sensors costing 10s of rupees or less, a global Internet with almost limitless bandwidth, and enormous storage in global clouds. The present era is full of technological advances in almost all spectrums of life and we are flooded with enormous amounts of data. There is an increasing demand of capturing, analyzing, and synthesizing this large amount of data in a number of application domains to better understand various phenomena and to convert the information available in the data into actionable strategies such as new scientific discoveries, business applications, policy making, and healthcare etc. Data science is the area where applications of various tools and techniques from the disciplines of applied statistics, mathematics and computer science are used to get greater insight and to make better and informed decisions for various purposes by analysing a large amount of data. Jim Gray, database pioneer, has called Data Science the 4th paradigm of science. The first 3 are the empirical, the theoretical and the computational paradigms. In industry there is an escalating demand for trained professionals that can collect, process, and study the large data sets and reveal underlying trends and other insights. Consequently, the study of data science as a discipline has become essential to cater the growing need for professionals and researchers to deal with the future challenges. Given the mounting importance of the data science paradigm, IIT Mandi has decided to start a new 4 years bachelor program on Data Science and Engineering (DSE). The curriculum of the DSE program focuses on exposing to the students with the essentials of applied statistics, applied mathematics, and computer science required in the context of data science and its applications with strong emphasis on having hands-on experience with the help of practicum, labs and experience of dealing with real-world problems. Objectives of the program After the completion of the degree, students would 1. be prepared with a varied range of expertise in different aspects of data science such as data collection, visualization and processing large data sets. 2. acquire a good understanding of both the theory and application of applied statistics, applied mathematics and computer science based existing data science models to analyse huge data sets originating from diversified application areas. 3. be able to create new models using the knowledge acquired from the program to solve future challenges and real-world problems requiring large scale data analysis. 4. be better trained professionals to cater the growing demand for data scientists and engineers in industry."],

        "responses": ["Engineering Physics (EP) at IIT Mandi is a unique program, which is designed to prepare graduates with rigorous foundation in Physics along with Engineering in order to tackle today’s technology challenges. EP will enhance the cross-functionality and bridge the gap between pure science and traditional engineering disciplines which so far have been pursued independently. This is necessary because in today’s world major scientific and technological breakthroughs happen in a multi-disciplinary environment where scientists from pure science work along with engineers. It is, therefore, highly important to inculcate both scientific and technological aspects, and the EP programme will serve this purpose. The curriculum for EP at IIT Mandi introduces students to a wide variety of fields in pure as well as applied Physics. The core courses cover basic areas in Physics, such as Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics and Condensed Matter Physics; as well as basic courses in Mathematics and Engineering. In addition to the compulsory courses, students will complete a certain number of elective courses in Physics intended to provide a good exposure in various directions in both theoretical and applied Physics. The vision is to cater to and enhance the curiosity of students with varied interests in the field. Besides, a number of courses in other branches of science and engineering, along with humanities and social sciences, will also be available as electives. This will allow students to explore their areas of interest. If a student is inclined towards electrical engineering, s/he can take the requisite number of courses/credits in that program and get a minor. Interdisciplinary areas in physical sciences and engineering, like Quantum technology, Photonics, Nano-electronics and Artificial Intelligence, promise to become dominant in the 21 st century. EP that teaches science underlying engineering will prepare students to apply Physics to tackle these 21st century engineering challenges and vice-versa. Additionally, EP will also prepare students to pursue an advanced degree in Physics as well as engineering. "],

        "responses": ["Indian Institute of Technology Mandi is offering a unique B.Tech-M.Tech Integrated Dual Degree programme in Bioengineering that is aimed at providing students with a broad base knowledge of engineering principles and practices to understand the biological world. Ranging from sensing of data from the biological world, to actuation through prosthetics, from computational models to understand the biological world to machine learning techniques for diagnosis, the programme aims to offer a wide plethora of problem solving opportunities derived from the biological world. The programme, unique of its kind looks at Bioengineering from a more generalized perspective without getting limited to only Biomedical Engineering, as is commonly envisioned at many engineering institutions in the country. This widens the horizon of the student at a Bachelor’s level who can then choose to specialize in the different areas of Bioengineering like Biomedical Engineering, Agro-Technology, Computational Bioengineering or Environmental Science and Engineering. Such a programme definitely provides an exploratory approach to understanding Bioengineering, postponing the notion of specializing in a particular domain area to a later stage allowing a student to introspect into his/her potential while taking lessons on basic biology and computational, electrical and mechanical engineering principles. Coupled with IIT Mandi’s philosophy of providing a broad base engineering education, the programme perfectly synergizes engineering fundamentals with biological domain areas with the intent of generating engineering manpower endowed with a sufficient appreciation towards biology. The biological world is vast and extracting information from the biological world requires in depth understanding of electrical, mechanical and computational engineering principles and practices with significant understanding of the biological world. The discipline of bioengineering has evolved drastically over the past 50 years, seemingly encompassing all fields that include bioelectric phenomena, bioinformatics, biomaterials, biomechanics, bioinstrumentation, biosensors, biosignal processing, biotechnology, computational biology, medical imaging, etc. The B.Tech and M.Tech dual degree programme on Bioengineering strives to train students in the field of physical, chemical, mathematical and biological sciences together with engineering principles for the development of technology aimed at providing diagnostic, therapeutic and assistive and analytical support to biological systems. The programme strives to train the students in the field of basic electrical and mechanical engineering disciplines together with principles in physical, chemical, mathematical, computational and biological sciences for inculcating knowledge enabling them in developing and deploying Bioengineering related technologies in various fields.

        "responses": ["This unique fully faculty-mentored Induction Programme (which began in 2016) is based on the assumption that although there are pronounced differences in both abilities and skills among college-entering students, these students are not given enough time and training to get used to the ethos of an IIT. The 5WIP treats all students as unique individuals with their specific strengths and weaknesses. It gives all students a chance—before their rigorous, grade-oriented classes begin—to acquire the critical skills that will enable them to follow lectures with ease, gain the confidence to ask questions of their teachers, and to feel at ease in their new home: the IIT residential campus. In the 5WIP, students spend their first 5 weeks in an intense, meticulously planned and executed daily routine before regular classes begin. The components of the 5WIP may be classified into the following five categories: Engineering Modules In the Exploring Engineering module, students are exposed to the excitement of real-world engineering through interactive group-work. Faculty members from different engineering disciplines guide students to discover what exactly a career in engineering entails. Students are given carefully chosen projects to create (for example a boomerang and a circuit board) and are encouraged to experiment with conceptual and material tools. This module opens up exciting vistas for students towards the four years ahead. It demystifies engineering and students learn the interconnectedness of all branches of engineering in real-world scenarios. Visual Thinking, a critical skill for engineers, is an activity based module in which students learn the power of pencil sketches for engineering design. For example, they have to conceptualize and sketch all components of a metro station or a student mess hall. In the Computer Proficiency Module, students in randomly chosen groups are given basic familiarity with computer hardware and software. As students are in randomly chosen groups, students who are better at a skill/subject are encouraged to help their group members. At the same time, the more skilled students are also given optional, more challenging assignments. Life Skills This component is intended to bring all students up to a minimum level in skills essential for the rigorous IIT classes. This includes English and Soft Skills modules. Each student, irrespective of his/her initial proficiency level, spends these hours acquiring or honing his/her English and Soft Skills. Life Essentials In this component, students are encouraged to explore the interconnected worlds of self, family and society, i.e. Human Values. The idea is to equip students with the capacity to reflect on their decisions and actions, to develop their values and ethics, and to conduct themselves in society with maturity and finesse. On weekends, students are taken on visits to old age homes and orphanages, and participate in tree-plantation and cleanliness drives. Life Enhancements By participating in a variety of sports, including yoga and creative activities (a theatre workshop, visual arts and music), students taste a range of extra-curricular activities, some of which may turn into hobbies for life. Inspirational Activities Here, eminent speakers from all walks of life are invited to address students. Introduction to student activities on campus such as gymkhana, clubs, film screenings and other Evening Activities keep students happily occupied in the evening hours. With the IIT Mandi philosophy of learning to learn, students no longer expect teachers to spoon feed information to them. The 5WIP is, therefore, intended to help students become more self-sufficient and self-confident. Assessments at the end of the programme over the last three years indicate that these aims have been met much beyond our initial expectations. Unique Features of 5WIP 1. Students are mentored in small groups of 20 by faculty, and not by external experts. This facilitates bonding between students and faculty which enriches the rest of the 4 years. 2. There is great emphasis on the excitement of engineering, leading into the regular curriculum. 3. There is considerable emphasis on the creative arts and sports as well for holistic development of the students. 4. The unique Himalayan location of IIT Mandi facilitates outreach activities directed towards the Himachali community. "],

Female candidates compete for the female seats first and then for the gender-neutral seats. Hence, only the common rank list is used. The female supernumerary seat scheme is introduced for the second time this year. The opening and closing ranks of female supernumerary seats for year 2019 are available on the JoSAA website. This year, about 20% of seats in every branch at every IIT (except IIT Mandi where it is 20%) have been designated as 'female-only' seats (this has been done by creating sufficient supernumerary seats, without any reduction in the number of seats available to non-female candidates). So if you are a qualified female candidate, this year you have quite a good chance of getting an IIT seat, and a better chance than previous years of getting a branch and IIT of your choice! Hence all female candidates are advised to not go just by previous years' closing ranks, but instead fill in as many of their genuine preferences as they can, in order to maximise their chances of getting a high-preference branch and/or campus. Since many IITs have introduced new courses and total number seats are higher, the opening and closing ranks may change this year. There are two rounds of mock seat allocations and this would give you an idea about the chances of getting a particular choice according to your rank. If you are passionate about some branch or some IIT, put those at the head of your choice list. Then, list a large number of other branches and IITs, even if you are not very keen on them. IITs give students many opportunities to pursue their passion regardless of the branch that they join. "],
